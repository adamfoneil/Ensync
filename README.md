This is a reboot of my [ModelSync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync) project, to break from the NETStandard2 dependency, refactor the diff engine with fresh eyes, and to rebuild all the tooling. There will be a console app for scripting and merging code-first entities. The long term vision is to have a WPF GUI app remake of [ModelSync UI](https://aosoftware.net/modelsync/).
